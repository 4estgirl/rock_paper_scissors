# rock_paper_scissors

This is my first JavaScript project! The goal of this project is to use JavaScript to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game you can play against the computer.

Goals of the game
- The game should be played for 5 rounds. Score should be displayed at all times.
- User should input "Rock" "Paper" or "Scissors". The scrips should accept these three words with any combination of capitalization.
- The computer should choose "Rock" "Paper" or "Scissors" randomly.
- Upon the results of a round, something like "You Lose! Paper beats Rock" should be displayed.
- At the end of the final round, the winner of the game should be displayed.
